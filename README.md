## Overview
PanoramaBlock is designed to transform raw crypto market data into structured, actionable insights. It operates as an ecosystem that seamlessly collects, processes, and distributes data, enabling users and systems to interact with relevant information in real-time with high reliability. By integrating multiple data sources and structuring them effectively, our intelligent agents provide insights, optimize DeFi strategies, and automate on-chain processes.

---

## **Technical Architecture**
### **1. Data Collection Layer**
The system starts by collecting raw data from multiple sources:
- **APIs**: External market data providers such as CoinGecko, Coinbase, and blockchain explorers.
- **Subgraphs**: GraphQL-based indexing of blockchain data.
- **RPCs**: Direct interaction with blockchain nodes for real-time data retrieval.
- **Internet Scraping**: AI-based analysis of market trends, news, and community sentiment.

Each data source feeds structured or unstructured data into **Apache Kafka**, ensuring high-throughput ingestion and real-time processing capabilities.

### **2. Data Processing and Storage**
Once ingested, the raw data is transformed:
- **Data Transformation**: Standardizes and enriches data with metadata and quality checks.
- **Data Storage**:
  - **Data Lake**: Stores raw blockchain data for historical analysis.
  - **Data Warehouse**: Optimized for fast queries and structured analytics, using tools such as **ClickHouse**.
- **Encryption and Security**: Sensitive data is secured using asymmetric cryptography before storage.

### **3. AI & Intelligent Agents**
The AI system utilizes a multi-agent approach:
- **ZICO Smart Agent**: The primary AI engine that:
  - Monitors significant transactions and whale movements.
  - Automates DeFi transactions and swaps.
  - Performs predictive market analysis using real-time data.
- **Multi-Agent System**: Includes specialized agents for different blockchains and financial strategies.
- **API Integrations**: Facilitates seamless interaction with external services.

### **4. User Interaction and Distribution**
- **Frontend Interface**: A **Next.js-based dashboard** provides visual analytics and insights.
- **APIs**: Developers can interact with the platform via API endpoints.
- **Automated Alerts & Reports**: Users receive AI-generated notifications based on market movements.
